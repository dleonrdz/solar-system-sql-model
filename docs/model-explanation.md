# Solar System Data Model Explanation

## GENERAL OVERVIEW

This data model has been meticulously designed to represent the main celestial bodies that compose our solar system: stars, planets, and moons, alongside related entities such as physical properties, elements, scientists, missions, and space agencies. The primary goal is to offer a structured and relational representation of the solar system and the exploration activities associated with it, providing a foundation for insightful analysis and data-driven discovery.

## KEY CHARACTERISTICS

### Central Entity - Celestial Body
The "Celestial Body" entity is at the heart of this data model, encompassing all celestial bodies of interest. This entity captures shared attributes such as mass, serving as a central point that connects to various types of celestial bodies.

### Diverse Celestial Body Types
The model distinguishes between different celestial body types (star, planet, moon), each linked to the "Celestial Body" entity through a one-to-one relationship. This design emphasizes the unique identity of each celestial body.

### Solar System Hierarchy
Adhering to the solar system's hierarchical structure, the model supports the representation of stars with orbiting planets and planets with moons through one-to-many associations, reflecting the natural celestial arrangements.

### Element Occurrence
"Element Occurrence" entities link celestial bodies to their elemental compositions, detailing the abundance percentages of each element. This allows for a detailed examination of the materials that constitute celestial bodies.

### Mission Exploration
The "Mission" entity encapsulates human exploratory activities directed at celestial bodies, indicating that a body may be the focus of none, one, or multiple missions. This includes detailed information about the missions, spacecraft, and space agencies involved.

### Mission Expansion Details
Details about spacecraft, space agencies, and the scientists involved in missions are integrated within the model. The approach to location modeling utilizes the Global Location Number (GLN) system, enriching the dataset with spatial context.

### Scientistsâ€™ Expertise
The model recognizes the specialized nature of scientific expertise, assigning a single area of expertise to each scientist involved in space missions, reflecting the high level of specialization required for such endeavors.
